# Ad-Hoc-Insights

## Company: AtliQ Hardwares

**AtliQ Hardwares** is an imaginary leading computer hardware producer in India with a global presence. The company is committed to leveraging data analytics to drive smart, data-informed decisions.

## Challenge

AtliQ Hardwares identified a gap in their ability to make quick, smart data-informed decisions. To bridge this gap, they aimed to expand their data analytics team by hiring junior data analysts proficient in both technical and soft skills. Tony Sharma, their Data Analytics Director, devised a SQL challenge to evaluate these skills.

## My Task

- Reviewing the `ad-hoc-requests.pdf`, which contained 10 ad hoc business requests requiring insights.
- Writing and executing SQL queries to answer these requests.
- Creating a presentation to showcase these insights, targeting top-level management.

## My Approach

1. **Data Extraction with SQL**:
   - Utilized MySQL to run queries and pull the necessary data.
   
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Leveraged Power BI to visualize the output, making the insights clear and compelling.
   
3. **Presentation Design**:
   - Designed an engaging and professional presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint to effectively communicate the insights.
   
4. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Provided actionable insights and recommendations to assist the management team in making informed decisions.

## Outcome

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to handle complex data queries and present findings in an engaging and insightful manner. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to communicate data-driven insights effectively.
